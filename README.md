Description:Conducted a comprehensive clustering analysis on customer data from a shopping mall to gain insights into consumer behavior and preferences. Leveraged unsupervised machine learning techniques, including k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, to categorize customers based on their shopping patterns.

Skills Utilized: Machine Learning, Clustering Analysis, Python, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Customer Segmentation, Unsupervised Learning.

Impact: Uncovered distinct customer segments with similar preferences, enabling the mall management to tailor marketing strategies and optimize store layouts. The project facilitates a more personalized shopping experience for customers, contributing to increased customer satisfaction and improved business outcomes

K-means clustering groups similar data points by iteratively adjusting cluster centers until they stabilize. It's useful for 
pattern recognition but requires selecting the number of clusters in advance and may struggle with complex shapes or outliers
